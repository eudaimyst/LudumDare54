game concept:
Players submit words using characters on screen that fit within the limited space
As a word is submitted a new boundary is drawn using the letters that made the word thus reducing the available number of words remaining

3 building a layoutGenerator with adjustable ring count and letter spacing
2 will try letters in a radial layout
1 upon drawing the keyboard layout to screen I realised it would not work for the game concept
