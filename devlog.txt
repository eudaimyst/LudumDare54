game concept:
Players submit words using characters on screen that fit within the limited space
As a word is submitted a new boundary is drawn using the letters that made the word thus reducing the available number of words remaining

9 just added a quick offset fix for text on html5 (known solar2d issue) thanks to @Siu in their discord
8 now I need to add boundary points for the keys then generate a shape with the boundary points once a letter is added to the word
7 I was going to use a simple toggle for the letters, but I need to check if they are in the word instead and only deactivate if not
6 hit my first snag with lots of debugging print statements to randomize the letter positions, got it eventually, oh the joys of working with lua
5 had to add random angle offset to prevent weird math layouts where the keys were lined up in rows
4 found a suitable layout, can see lots of potential for this concept, easier if vowels / common letters are towards the middle for example
3 building a layoutGenerator with adjustable ring count and letter spacing
2 will try letters in a radial layout
1 upon drawing the keyboard layout to screen I realised it would not work for the game concept
